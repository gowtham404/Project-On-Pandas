🏃 Ultra-Marathon Data Analysis with Pandas

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of one of the largest ultra-marathon datasets ever collected, using the Pandas library in Python. The analysis focuses on uncovering trends in participation, performance, and demographics in ultra-distance running events.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The Big Dataset of Ultra-Marathon Running
This dataset comprises over 7 million race records from ultra-marathon events held globally between 1798 and 2022. It captures detailed runner and event-level information, making it an excellent resource for in-depth analysis of long-distance endurance sports.

Key features include:
	•	Runner Info: Name, gender, nationality, and birth year
	•	Event Info: Race name, date, location, and distance
	•	Performance Metrics: Finish time, speed, placement, DNF (Did Not Finish) status
	•	Participation History: Multiple appearances by runners across years and events

⸻

🔧 Technologies Used
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Pandas
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	(Optional) Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations

⸻

📊 Key Tasks Performed
	•	Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected datatypes, and parsed dates
	•	Data Wrangling: Standardized race names and locations, extracted distance types
	•	Performance Analysis: Analyzed average speeds, top finishers, and year-over-year trends
	•	Demographics Study: Grouped runners by gender, age, and nationality
	•	Participation Trends: Identified the most frequent participants and long-term event popularity
	•	Time-Series Insights: Observed changes in average finish times and participation from 1800s to 2020s

⸻
🚀 Getting Started
	1.	Clone or download the repository.
	2.	Open Pandas_Project.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any IDE supporting .ipynb files.
	3.	Run through the notebook to explore the evolution of ultra-marathon running over centuries.

✅ Outcome

By completing this project, you’ll gain hands-on experience in:
	•	Analyzing large-scale time-series sports data
	•	Performing advanced Pandas operations
	•	Cleaning and transforming real-world messy datasets
	•	Generating meaningful insights on endurance events over a 200+ year period
